## Endpoint (Mockapi.io)

Tasky uses a free mock backend API to illustrate a more real-world implementation. Although it is grossly a shadow of what the actual implementation would be as this API is quite limited.

```ts
API_ENDPOINT = https://API_KEY.mockapi.io/api/v1/:
METHODS: GET, GET /tasks/:id, POST, PUT: /tasks/:id, DELETE: /tasks/:id
```
